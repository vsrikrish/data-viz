@ARTICLE{Hochstein2002-rv,
  title    = "View from the top: hierarchies and reverse hierarchies in the
              visual system",
  author   = "Hochstein, Shaul and Ahissar, Merav",
  abstract = "We propose that explicit vision advances in reverse hierarchical
              direction, as shown for perceptual learning. Processing along the
              feedforward hierarchy of areas, leading to increasingly complex
              representations, is automatic and implicit, while conscious
              perception begins at the hierarchy's top, gradually returning
              downward as needed. Thus, our initial conscious percept--vision
              at a glance--matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene
              interpretation, identifying ``forest before trees.'' For later
              vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention
              to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into
              conscious perception detailed information available there.
              Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit
              perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of
              phenomena. Feature search ``pop-out'' is attributed to high
              areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention
              detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or
              fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific
              receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with
              recently reported primary visual cortex effects.",

  title    = "Tracking multiple independent targets: evidence for a parallel
              tracking mechanism",
  author   = "Pylyshyn, Z W and Storm, R W",
  abstract = "There is considerable evidence that visual attention is
              concentrated at a single locus in the visual field, and that this
              locus can be moved independent of eye movements. Two studies are
              reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention
              require that locations be scanned serially, at least one
              operation may be carried out in parallel across several
              independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of
              indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show
              that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects
              in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to
              distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor;
              and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are
              designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative
              assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding
              times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and
              updating algorithm would not exceed about 40\% accuracy, subjects
              still manage to do the task with 87\% accuracy. These findings
              are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently
              motivated model of feature-binding--called the FINST model--which
              posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes
              and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These
              indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual
              features prior to subsequent pattern recognition.",

              solution to the problem of visual search: a preattentive stage
              that could process a limited number of basic features in parallel
              and an attentive stage that could perform more complex acts of
              recognition, one object at a time. The theory posed a series of
              problems. What is the nature of that preattentive stage? How do
              serial and parallel processes interact? How does a search unfold
              over time? Recent work has shed new light on these issues.",
